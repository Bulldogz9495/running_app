The front end mobile app utilizes react-native to code the ui as a react app. This code is then compiled remotely using expo go and deployed to the ios store using expo deploy.

#React-Native
The react native code base contains screens that allow the user to experience user workflows:

It contains a high level stack navigation that handles navigates between screens of the app.
It also contains a [[Message Screen]] button in the top right corner that persists across most screens and allows the user to access their messages.
