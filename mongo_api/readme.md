# Challenge Run
An idea that will allow runners to compete with each other in teams. The initial idea is a simple running app that will provide a score for each run. This score will be summed for a team and the teams scores will be calculated and compared allowing for competition. The original idea was for a city wide team (this can be the default) and cities can compete with each other. This will hopefully be an exciting and enjoyable way for runners and non-runners to get out their and move and compete. 

# Mongo API
This app is based on fastapi and pymongo and will host a set of endpoints that allow the front end to make rest requests to the mongo database.
